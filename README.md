Sorting Algorithm Performance Comparison

This repository contains a Python project that benchmarks the performance of various sorting algorithms across different array sizes. The algorithms included in this project are:

- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort

The project measures the time taken by each algorithm to sort arrays of varying sizes (from 100 to 100,000 elements) and presents the results in a structured table. This helps in analyzing and comparing the time complexity and performance of these algorithms in practice.

Features

- Benchmarking of 9 popular sorting algorithms.
- Time analysis for different array sizes.
- Simple, modular codebase to easily extend or modify.
- Ideal for learning and performance evaluation of sorting algorithms.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` for array generation (optional, based on implementation)
- `time` module for performance measurement

Usage

Clone the repository, run the Python script, and analyze the output table showing the execution times of each sorting algorithm for different array sizes.
